🧠 Neural Networks

📌 Description:
An image classification project built with TensorFlow that trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize images from a custom dataset. The trained model can predict the class of a new image and visualize the result.

🔧 Technologies:
Python, TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, Pillow (PIL), Matplotlib

📝 Functionality:

🧩 Model training on images using CNN architecture

🧠 Automatic class detection based on dataset folders

🖼️ Image prediction and visualization

📊 Validation accuracy tracking and model evaluation

💾 Model saving and reloading for inference
